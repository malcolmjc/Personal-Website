                  I'm Malcolm Craney, a fourth-year Software Engineering student at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, set to graduate <b>December 2019</b>. 
                  When I'm not in California, you will likely find me in my hometown of Portland, OR. I originally started my career here at college in a different major,
                  but soon realized my passion and appreciation for programming, computer science, and the mathematics behind it. What really
                  captured me was the magical feeling I got after learning a new language, tool, or framework, and the ability to manipulate
                  these incredibly complex devices and technologies at ease. If you're reading this website you're likely reviewing me as a 
                  prospective candidate, so I hope this provides you with a more holistic depiction of myself both as a programmer and as a person.

                    This past summer I had the awesome opportunity to work with Surescripts, the United States largest e-prescription network. I got to travel to their Minneapolis and Arlington Offices, 
                    and worked out of Hillsboro for the majority of the summer. I got to work with, learn, and explore a variety of technologies. Over the course of the summer I developed a project capable of
                    persisting and dynamically updating test details and history within company-wide JIRA issues. To accomplish this I used programming languages <b>Java</b>, <b>C#</b>, and <b>Javascript</b>, 
                    along with technologies like <b>Docker</b>, <b>WebSockets</b>, <b>JPA</b>, <b>OAuth</b>, <b>jQuery</b>, <b>NuGet</b>, and <b>Maven</b> . I also got to delve deeply into various testing frameworks
                    such as <b>xUnit</b>, <b>NUnit</b>, <b>SpecFlow</b>, <b>JUnit</b>, and <b>Selenium</b>. The whole project was completed utilizing the <b>Agile Scrum</b> development process, and using the <b>Atlassian</b>
                    family of products.

                            important communication skills through my numerous interactions with customers, and really learned how to "pitch" a product.

                            It taught me what it's like and what's expected from you while working for a large company, and how to both meet and
                            exceed those expectations. Most importantly, it taught me how to work with and help customers, which is very relevant
                            when collaborating with users in the creation of software.

                  Back in the summer of 2017, I had just finished my first two quarters of computer science courses, and was itching to learn more.
                  So, I decided to delve into the field of web development. I had observed the large political divide occuring in our country, and wanted
                  to build a tool to help alleviate political biases within articles. Thus, I published a chrome extension capable of identifying article sources
                  and rating their conservative/liberal bias based upon extensive research I had done. It was very rudimentary, but served as my introduction to 
                  web dev and <b>HTML</b>/<b>CSS</b>. Recently, I have been learning <b>Angular</b> and the <b>MEAN Stack</b>, and have decided to revamp the project utilizing these technologies.
                  I'm in the process of adding user voting for articles. The <b>Angular WebApp</b> will be the central component, along with a supporting extension to enable easier rating and 
                  access to ratings.
